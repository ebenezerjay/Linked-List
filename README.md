# Linked List
### By Ebenezer Ingalsbe
## Intro
  For this project I recreated a website that takes url's and appends them into bookmarks on the page. The site is supposed to be responsive
to mobile as well as desktop. And to match all of the details of the layout.
## How to use the application
  To add a bookmark, the user will type the title of the website being linked to and the url into two different text fields. You will 
not be able to submit your bookmark without entering both a title and url. Click the enter button to create the bookmark link. After
creating the link you can click the 'Read' button to show that youv'e read the link. You can click on the 'Read' button again to unread 
the bookmark. And if you don't want to keep that bookmark you can delete it by clicking on the 'Delete' button. The application keeps
track of all the total bookmarks and the total youv'e read as well as the unread bookmarks.
